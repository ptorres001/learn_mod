This repo was made, through much effort, to make it easier to do learn labs. In a quest to be able to save work on the labs without the worry of page refresh, this project was started. Will be updated as close to daily as possible.

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks about data science.

Few notes:

Any of the short pages that were just learning goals were not included.
Each mod gets its own folder, then the sections are separated, then the indivdual lessons are put in.
  
  The hiearchy is - Mod, Section, Lesson
  
Folders for quizzes are included but empty, at some point in time I amy include them when they can be used outside of Learn. Will look into it.
All lessons are numbered in the order they appear on the website.
Everything has been unzipped already, except for mod1 final project data, I believe.
More notes may be added later
