# Learn.co Data Science lessons

## Description

This repo is the collection of learn.co READMEs and Labs. In each are the lessons broken down from the beginning of the course.

## Layout

The hierarchy of the collection is broken down into the Module it was released, the section it was contained in, and the lesson. All of them are in chronological order in the way they were released.

- Module
- Section
- Lesson

Folders for quizzes are included but empty. Once I look into how it would run off of the learn.co site, I may include them. Solutions to the labs are not included. May be added in the future. 

## Notes

As of now they are updated until the evening of August 4th, 2020, which includes the first two days of Module 3.
